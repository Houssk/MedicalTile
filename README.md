MedicalTile
===========

Description
----------------
MedicalTile is an open source software for 2D, 3D and 4D medical image visualization and processing. 
It's based on Qt, ITK and DCMTK. It works on WIN32 platform for now.<br>

Feature
---------------
* Import CT or MR image folders.
* Display 3D image as slices.
* MPR view.
* Image processing algorithms including morphological algorithms, watershed algorithm, registration etc.
* Data visualization.
* 3D image series or 4D image, time-density curve of a ROI
* Zoom, pan, Window level/width
* Extremely extensible. 
     You can:
      * Add new algorithms
      * Add new data types 
      * Add new visualization panels for different data types. <br>(so far, only 3D image type, data array type can be visualized)

Screeshot
------------------------
####Images of a swine taken by a MRI
3D images of 20 time points or 4D image<br>
You can see gradual changes among these images indicating the injection and attenuation of contrast medium.

####Images of brain
MPR view

####MPR View in red, green, blue

####Image processing panel
You can freely save, move, select, delete and manipulate multple 3D images and other data types on this panel. <br>
All tiles are dragged from the main viewer, generated by an algorthm or loaded from files of a format particularly designed for each type of data.<br>
Each tile can represent a 3D image, a number array or other types.<br>

####Data visualization panel
You can set the range of X, Y axis, change the role of each row of numbers.

Plugin
-----------------
* DLL plugin. Inherit a base class running your GUI, receiving data from the main application, processing your data and returning the result to the main application. The main application can handle all the rest.
* XML plugin. kind of simple scrypt plugin. A XML plugin organizes existing plugins in a cascading manner. When you run a XML plugin, actually you run several different plugins cascadingly. <br>
The plugin below combines Subtraction, Gaussian, ROISegmentation, Threshold, Opening, and LargestComponent together.
```
      <Test>
      <version>1</version>
      <name>KidneySeg</name>
      <category>Kidney</category>
      <algo>Subtraction</algo>
      <algo>Gaussian</algo>
      <algo>ROISegmentation</algo>
      <algo>Threshold</algo>
      <algo>Opening</algo>
      <algo>LargestComponent</algo>
      </Test>
```
* Other scrypt plugin. I plan to embed a python interpreter inside my application, but it's not done yet.

How to compile?
---------------
####Step 1, download the 3rd party libraries.
* Download ITK 4.1.0 from [ITK](http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/legacy_releases.html)
* Download Qt >= 4.8.1 (I use 4.8.1 for this project, and Qt 4.8.5 also works fine) from [Qt](http://download.qt-project.org/archive/qt/4.8/)
* Download DCMTK3.6 from [DCMTK](http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en)

####Step 2, compile ITK, DCMTK, and Qt, if you donwload the qt source code package
* Download [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/download/).
* Use CMake to generate VS solution for ITK and DCMTK. <br>
Remember to set shared library option.
Remember to set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX before generating.<br>
Hint: CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is the path where you can get full library files after compilation. 
* Compile ITK and DCMTK.
* Run the INSTALL within each VS solution. After that, you will get full lib and heade files collected in one path same as CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX you set.
* Copy the 3rd party library files into the project and make the directory tree look like the following,
```

```
* Compile Qt, if you downloaded the source code instead of win32 binaries.

####Step 3, add 3rd pary libraries and compile. 
* Visual studio 2010 is suggested.<br>
* If you download the Qt binaries, install it.
* Install Qt add-in for visual studio. You can find it in the downloaded Qt package.<br>
* Add headers and libraries to visual studio. If you make the directory tree exactly as above, you can skip this step.<br>
* Then, open the sln file in your visual studio and click build!<br>

To do
----------------
* Reorganize this project using CMake to make path configuration easier when compiling.
* Add a curve fitting plugin.
* Some texts are still in Chinese. I need to fix it.
